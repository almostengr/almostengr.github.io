Think about it... do you really remember how much fertilizer that you used 4 years ago on the tomato plants? Probably not. Do you remember how many times that squirrels ate the strawberries before you did last season? Probably not. Do you know how many days that it rained last summer? Probably not. These are just a few examples of why you need to keep track of what you have observed and what you have done in your garden. I use this blog as my garden journal because I'm able to share with others what I've learned from running a garden. What do you need to keep track of in your journal? That's up to you! I would recommend keeping track of the following items and tasks: weather conditions, including temperature whether it rained or you manually watered your plants and the amount of water any pests, including those pesky squirrels, that have caused harm to or ate your plants when fertilizer was applied and how much when you started your seedlings when you harvested your food and the size of your harvest pictures of your observations Paper or digital (online) journal? Again, it's up to you! What's more important is that you keep records so that you are able to analyze what you have done. I've chosen to do an online blog because I know I can type faster than I write. Now if you have a digital or online blog, it is easier to find what you are looking for as you can utilize the search functionality. For example, if you create a journal entry each time that you harvest food from your garden, you can do a search for \"harvest\" and the fruit or vegetable that you harvested and find the information quickly. If you have a paper journal, you would have to manually look page by page until you found your latest harvest information. How often should I write in my journal? I would recommend writing a new entry daily or when significant events take place. For instance, if you have non-stop rain for an entire week, I would make note of that in a journal entry. Planting new vegetables for the growing season, make a new journal entry. Squirrels eat half of your three tomatoes, make a journal entry (and remove the half eaten tomatoes from the vine). Journaling may seem pointless in the beginning when you don't have much history to look back at. However as the time progresses and you make some gardening mistakes, you'll learn from those mistakes and end up with a productive and strong garden.","title":"Every Gardener Needs a Journal"},{"location":"gardening/2019-02-23-every-gardener-needs-a-journal/#what-do-you-need-to-keep-track-of-in-your-journal-thats-up-to-you","text":"I would recommend keeping track of the following items and tasks: weather conditions, including temperature whether it rained or you manually watered your plants and the amount of water any pests, including those pesky squirrels, that have caused harm to or ate your plants when fertilizer was applied and how much when you started your seedlings when you harvested your food and the size of your harvest pictures of your observations","title":"What do you need to keep track of in your journal?

Weather Summary However, Mother Nature decided to throw a curve ball with an unexpected frost after severe weather. I did see a post on social media about the groundhog got the weather forecast wrong. This is not surprising. What sense does it make to take weather advice from a cousin of a rodent? I'm just saying. Back to the subject at hand... the winter garden is still producing ready to eat food. This is a picture of a mustard green that I pulled from the garden. As you can see it is as long as my arm, which is over two feet in length. There were multiple leaves on the stalk like this one. Garden Harvest In total, I picked about 2 pounds of greens and still didn't make a dent in the on hand supply. I think part of the reason for the greens being able to grow so large is due to the large amounts of rain that have taken place in recent weeks. Also being able to control the snails, catepillar worms, and other pests that feed on them with a mixture of salt and flour has helped. Without this occasional pest control, they would devour the leaves resulting in holes or entire leaves missing. This week's weather has multiple frosty nights in the forecast. This is contrary to the severe weather and tornadoes that were experienced during the previous weekend. The frost will continue to control any pests that did start to set up shop on the leaves, especially the snails.","title":"Greens From the Winter Garden"},{"location":"gardening/2019-03-04-greens-from-the-winter-garden/#greens-from-the-winter-garden","text":"As we enter March, it's almost time to prepare for the summer garden.","title":"Greens From the Winter Garden"},{"location":"gardening/2019-03-04-greens-from-the-winter-garden/#weather-summary","text":"However, Mother Nature decided to throw a curve ball with an unexpected frost after severe weather.

As some of you may know, I have, for years, planted my fruits and vegetables mostly in containers and pots instead of directly in the ground. I\u2019ve learned a number of lessons about the differences between planting in the ground vs planting in containers. I\u2019ll cover that in another post. In this post, I will cover how I built multiple raised beds out of concrete blocks. Step 1: How Big and How Many Building a raised bed is simple, but you will need to do some calculations before getting started. I know you were probably not ready, but there is math involved. Nothing advanced like calculus, but you may need a calculator if you forgot your multiplication tables, so have one on standby just in case. For the width of the bed, I would recommend that it be a maximum of three blocks wide. Using 16 inch long blocks, that\u2019s just over 3 feet in total width. For the average gardener, that will allow you to at least reach the middle of the bed from either side. I used 5 blocks along the longer side and two sides on the ends for the bottom row. Then I used 3 blocks on the ends and 4 blocks along the sides on the top row. Thus a total of 14 blocks(5 per side times 2 sides = 10, 2 per side times 2 sides = 4, 10 + 4 = 14) per row. If you noticed, I did not use feet or inches as measurements. The reason being is that converting linear length to blocks is additional and unnecessary math for this project as there is an inside length (where the plants and dirt will go) and an outside length (where you would stand when picking your food) that would have to be calculated. Besides, when you go to make your purchase, they are going to want to know how many blocks that you want, not how many linear feet or inches or centimeters or yards or kilometers of blocks that you need. Step 2: Time To Go Shopping For this project, you will need the following: (Please consider using the affiliate links below this post. They help to support this website) concrete blocks (see Step 1 for how many blocks) spirit level (see link below) 2 feet wide object (a lawn mower works) Construction / Work Gloves masonry adhesive (optional) Why concrete blocks? Modern concrete blocks are made of just that... concrete (sand, water, cement). Considerations for using concrete blocks: the ones that you buy will mostlikely not contain any chemicals or other things that are poisionious or dangerous to your health. I would advise not getting blocks from unknown sources. are more expensive than wood. The total amount for the 56 blocks that I purchased was $84, before discounts and taxes have a very long outdoor life regardless of what the weather or ground conditions are like If you do not have the money for concrete blocks, then wood is an option. Considerations for using wood: wood is cheaper than concrete blocks. If you are looking to do gardening for the long term, the cheaper initial cost will be negated by the recurring replacement cost of the wood use untreated wood. Treated wood contains chemicals that can be hazardous to your health if consumed. the outdoor life of untreated wood is shorter than that of concrete. That means that if you live in an area with a lot of rainfall or high water table, that the wood will rot faster than average and therefore will need to be replaced sooner. Step 3: Site Selection After you have purchased the items above, you need to select a flat or mostly flat spot in your yard. My yard actually slopes towards one corner of the yard, so there isn't a truely flat spot in the yard. If you read other articles, they will recommend leveling out the place where you will be placing the blocks to be level. Personally I did not level out anything as digging up dirt and grading it so that it is level is back-breaking work, unless you have a bobcat or some other heavy machinery to assist you with the job. However if your growing space is significantly out of level, I would recommend that you do some grading of the ground. Step 4: Dropping Bricks Now... do not actually drop the brick wildy as it might land on your foot or smash to pieces. Once you have identified your location, start placing your blocks according to the configuration that you have decided on. For this step, you can use the spirit level to make sure that the blocks line up with one another. If you have chosen to secure your blocks, you can use the masonry adhesive between each block that you place. Step 5: Spacing Between Beds If you are making multiple beds, you will want to make a pathway between each of the beds so that have access to all of the sides of the grow bed. For the sake of simplicity, I used my lawn mower to determine the width of the spacing between the beds. Most push and walk behind lawn mowers are between 18 and 22 inches wide. That is almost two feet of space that you did not have to measure. In addition, as you lay out your bed, you do not have to continously re-check the width of the walking path to make sure that it is equal. You now have as much growing space that you can manage. In the next post, I will cover the dirt that I use for the beds.","title":"Building Raised Garden Beds"},{"location":"gardening/2019-03-11-building-raised-garden-beds/#step-1-how-big-and-how-many","text":"Building a raised bed is simple, but you will need to do some calculations before getting started.

The Alabama Cooperative Extension System (ACES) is based out of Auburn University (it hurts to type that... Roll Tide... That's better!) and Alabama A and M University. Each county has a county extension office that has resources and information about growing a variety of plants in that county. They do soil testing in addition to community training programs on topics including vegetable gardening, pollination, and more. There are number of resources and publications available on their website for almost everything agricultural. Do note that the resources are targeted for Alabama, but they may apply in other states. I have not had the opportunity to fully use the app at the time of this writing, but will do a follow up post after I plant my summer garden. From my limited usage, I have been able to determine the below pros and cons: Pros Has information for a number of plants, including days to maturity, when to plant, and plant spacing What can be planted today to be a successful grower Farmer's market locations Contacting your local county extension directly from the app Cons Does not allow for the exporting of data entered into the app. Designed only for Alabama. However it can be used for tracking your gardening activities. However the planting dates and information may be incorrect if you live outside of the USDA growing zones that exist in Alabama. At the time of this post, it has not been updated since 2016. It only has information for 37 vegetables and fruits. This is far less than what can be grown in Alabama. Steps to Do Setup 1) Initial set up has to be done. You have to enter the county that you are located in to begin using the app. 2) A number of options are available with this app including contacting the Alabama Cooperative Extension System. 3) SOW App recommends what plants to plant and when it can be planted. Conclusion Now if you look at the rating for this app, it only has 3 stars at the time of this writing. However, if you read the comments that are associated with the reviews, it has some negative reviews from people that do not live in the state of Alabama because the app is not designed for their state. The reviews from those that do live in Alabama, seem to be at least 3 starts or above. Starting this growing season, I will be using it to see how it fairs with actual usage.

Just a demostration showing the process of what I did get it done. Just removing a dead and decaying tree limb from a tree. The limb has been dead for some time. It was resting a branch that was in front of it. Also some of the upper limbs would break off during windy conditions, thus creating a safety hazard. The first attempt was to shake the branch back and for in hopes that it would eventually break loose. However that strategy did not work as it was still connected near the base of the tree. A number of the upper limbs did break off as result of the rocking. Next I attempted to chop the base of the branch with a hatchett. I didn't have an axe on hand, although this would have been the preferred tool for the job. The core of the limb was still mostly solid, thus difficult to chop through. So I removed as much of the decayed wood from the base of the limb as possible so that it would be easier to break free. Next I tried to push down the branch.

Just a demostration showing the process of what I did get it done. Just removing a dead and decaying tree limb from a tree. The limb has been dead for some time. It was resting a branch that was in front of it. Also some of the upper limbs would break off during windy conditions, thus creating a safety hazard. The first attempt was to shake the branch back and for in hopes that it would eventually break loose. However that strategy did not work as it was still connected near the base of the tree. A number of the upper limbs did break off as result of the rocking. Next I attempted to chop the base of the branch with a hatchett. I didn't have an axe on hand, although this would have been the preferred tool for the job. The core of the limb was still mostly solid, thus difficult to chop through. So I removed as much of the decayed wood from the base of the limb as possible so that it would be easier to break free. Next I tried to push down the branch. However this did not work as I was not able to get much leverage from pushing. In addition, the limb would slide back after pushing. Since that attempt failed, I got a tow rope and connected it to the tree. The tow rope was slick, so I put a shovel on the other end of the rope to use it as a handle.

However, there are some advantages and disadvantages to doing container gardening or gardening in pots versus putting your fruits and vegetables directly into the ground. In this post I'm a cover those differences that I've experienced with my growing experiences. So for the past several years I have been growing all of my purse and vegetables in containers instead of the putting them directly in the ground. However, I have noticed that my neighbor has majority of his plant directly in the ground or in raised beds. So after doing some years of research of just only planting in containers or pots these are some things that I've noticed about this process. The Benefits Having your plant in a container versus directly in the ground allows you to better customize the soil to based upon the plant that is that particular container. For instance blueberries have a tendency to prefer more acidic soil versus less a tomato plants. That being said if you have a blueberry plant in just a specific container you can adjust the ratios of your soil so that it is acidic versus having an entire bed that has to be adaptable to a wide variety of everything that you put in that bed. Another benefit of planting in containers is that you can move the container or wherever you need to depending upon the time of year. For instance some plants require more sun song require more shade. As the seasons change you can move the plant to a more shaded area if the plant actually needs more shade or move it to a more Sunny your area and if it needs more sun. Growing in containers actually can restrict the limit of how far the plants can grow out. For instance peppermint plants, is a very vine-like plant. That being said I planted a peppermint plant in a container of about two years ago and after about a year to a year-and-a-half, the peppermint plant had actually become almost root bound in that container. In addition, the peppermint plant itself was actually trying to grow out of the container but it wasn't able to do so since the container was fairly high off the ground and it wasn't able to actually take root into the ground itself. The Negatives The major thing that I've noticed about container gardening is that the soil in the containers have a tendency to dry out faster during hotter weather. The reason is that the pot only can hold so much water and once that water start to evaporate it can't pull water from anywhere else. In my scenario from the last several years, I've actually had to make sure that I watered the container plants every day or every other day and depending upon the temperature and when the last time it rained. Another negative that exist with using containers or pots is that when the weather becomes very severe that the container can actually flip over depending on is dementia. I've used 5-gallon buckets and the five gallon buckets during severe weather in Alabama can lead up to winds in the 40 or more mile an hour range. With these high winds or higher winds, this can result in the plant being knocked over and dirt falling out as well as any reserve water being knocked out as well. This past winter, I noticed that the birds that were migrating through my area would land in the yard and go under the plants that were directly into the ground however they would not go into the ones that were in containers or pots. I'm not sure why that was the case, but it may have had something to do with the birds not being able to see what is in the pot before they go flying into it. Now you may think that birds being able to get into a pot is very insignificant, but they actually play a major role in farming and gardening. In my experience has the birds actually eat the pests like ladybugs, caterpillars, and horn worms, just to name a few, that would normally attack the leaves on the plants that you are growing. With all this being said, this year I will be growing with a combination of in ground beds as well as containers and pots. Hopefully this has given you a good perspective of the differences between growing in the ground versus growing in a container or a pot.

I recently got asked by a high school classmate how I got started with my garden and any tips that I could provide them with to help them get started with hers. In addition, the big box stores are having their spring Black Friday sales. Which means plants and all things plant related,including dirt, tools, etc. are on sale right now. Check your local sales paper for the dates and the details. With the spring Black Friday sale, this is the perfect time for you to start your summer garden. Below I have outlined 8 steps for you to get started. Step 1) Determine A Location The first step to get started with a garden is to determine where you are going to set up your garden in the amount of sunlight that that area gets in a day. If you intend on growing fruits and vegetables this season, then you will want to pick a spot that has mostly sun or is full sun throughout the entire day. The reason is that most fruits and vegetables require a lot of energy to generate those fruits and vegetables that we enjoy, or hate if you are a kid. Step 2) Container Garden Or In The Ground Once you have decided where you want to set up your garden, then you will need to determine whether you are doing a container garden or a garden in the ground or raised beds. I categorize in the ground and raised beds into the same category because they're both permanent fixtures that you set up. Container garden includes putting plants inside of a container, such as a 5 gallon (18.93 liters) bucket, a pot, an old trash can, or a drum. You get the idea. When I first started gardening, I gardened with only containers. This year I've expanded to gardening with raised beds using cinder blocks in addition to the containers I already have. Step 3) Gardening Tools Next you'll want to purchase some gardening tools. You don't need any advanced tools for most of the work. At the very minimum, you want to have a shovel and gloves . The size of the shovel will be determined by what type of garden you choose to set up. A container garden only needs to have a hand shovel whereas a raised bed or in-ground garden needs to have a full size shovel . If you're setting up a raised bed or in-ground garden, I recommend that you also purchase a rake . The rake will help you to level out the dirt and other materials that you are placing in your garden. Gardening gloves will be used to protect your hands. However, if you have latex or other type of gloves those will do the job as well. Step 4) All Dirt Is Not Equal Once you have decided on the type of garden that you want set up, then you will need to get the type of soil that corresponds to the type of garden that you're going to set up. I know what you are thinking...there are different types of soil? Yes there are two distinct types of soil that are sold at the big box stores. The first type of soil is called garden soil. Garden soil is intended to be used directly on the ground or as part of an amendment to the existing ground soil. The other type of soil is called potting mix. Potting mix is designed to be used in some type of container. The major difference between the two types of soil is how well they retain and drain water. Garden soil drains more easily because it has the rest of the ground to disperse excess water into and then reclaim it at a future point in time. However, potting mix does not disperse water as easily and will actually retain more of the water in the soil and disperse the extra after retention. The reason for this is that pots are not able to pull water from other locations other than the water that has been given to them. Whereas the water that's in the ground can be drawn in by plant even if it's not directly underneath the plant or in the soil that the plant is in direct contact with. Step 5) Soil Amendments The soil that you buy from the store can be used immediately. However, when I buy soil from the store, I always add some amendments to it to better the growth of my plants. Those amendments include Epsom salt, peat moss, and compost. For my plants, I use 1/3 of soil, 1/3 of peat moss, and 1/3 of compost. I use the \"it looks about right\" method when measuring out the materials. However if you want to be exact with your measurements, you can by 1 cu ft of peat moss, compost, and soil and then mix them together. A reasonable amount of epsom salt should also be added. Epsom salts provides additional minerals that normally do not come with soil or from off the shelf fertilizers. Epsom salt, as you may know, is magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate is a second-level mineral as it was described to me, that helps promote the growth of plants. Peat moss helps with water retention within the soil. It also helps aerate the soil when water is added and removed as peat moss expands and contracts. Compost adds decomposed materials and other organic matter to your soil including nutrients. Organic matter is vital to the growth of the plant as the goal of having a healthy garden is to have a sustainable ecosystem. Step 6) Fruits, Vegetables, or Flowers Now that you have your soil you can decide on what type of plants that you want to put in the soil. When you go to purchase the plants that you want to Garden, be sure to look at the tag that comes with the plant. On the tag it will include how much sunlight that the plant needs in order to survive, The water requirements, and what the plant is. When I plant my fruits and vegetables, I usually leave the tag and next to where the plant is. That way in the future I know what the plant is that I'm looking at in a given location. If you happen to lose the tag that goes with a particular plant or a plant does not come with a tag, you can use a plastic butter knife next to the plant and write the name of the plant on the butter knife. Depending on the length of the growing season in the region that you are in, some Fruits and vegetables may not be possible to be grown in your area as it may not be warm enough for the correct amount of days. Step 7) Just Add Water Plants, like any other living creature, need water. The guidelines that I follow regarding water for my outdoor plants is every other day during the hottest part of the season. During the cooler parts of the year, I usually water as needed. This need is determined based upon how dry the top inch to inch and a half of the soil is. If it rains on a given day during the hottest part of the season, I do not water my plants. The reason being is that you want the plants to be able to manage without going daily with water, in case you decide to go on vacation. Step 8) Now That's Some Good Eating I know the section heading is not grammatically correct, but it does prove a point. Once your fruits or vegetables have reached their harvest date,then they are free to pick. How do you know what the harvest date is? The harvest date is written on the tag that comes with the plant. It is possible that the fruit or vegetable can be harvested prior or after the harvest date, but it's not advisable to do so as you want the plant to mature to the best of his ability. Do note that the harvest day is more of an advisory than an exact measurement. The conditions that the plant is in,such as the amount of sun, the amount of water, the health of the soil all play a factor into whether that harvest day is exact or not.

Weather has changed for the cooler and you have a bunch of leaves in your yard. Are you really going to want to spend time raking them? Probably not. There are various ways to handle leaves when the season change. Let Leaves Leave That's right. You can leave them in the yard and eventually they will blow into the street, decompose, or blow into the neighbors yard on their own. I took this approach one season and all was good during the winter time. However, when the weather started getting warmer, the grass was not growing. Come to find out, the leaves have smothered the grass during the winter. Thus resulting the grass dying completely and weeds taking over like they had nothing else to do. This is an approach that I would not recommend, especially if you like to have a lush, green lawn. Blow Them Away I have one neighbor that blows all of his leaves from his yard to the curb. Then the city will come by and scoop them up with other tree, limb, and other debris. In turn, the city uses those leaves for mulch, compost, or other projects around the city like in parks or roadside greenways. Chop It Up This is my preferred method. Pull out the lawn mower and mulch the leaves. In years past, I've mulched them and left them on the ground to decompose. This helps return the nutrients that were removed from the soil, to go back into the soil. Also prevents the need to bag the leaves, which means more work. I rarely bag leaves, as it adds unnecessarily to the landfill. If you have a compost pile, leaves are good brown material that can be added to the pile.

Greens don't make seeds until the spring or summer time. When they make seeds, they make a lot. Not sure at this point whether I'm going to let them continue to grow in the grass or cut the grass and greens once the summer growing season starts. For now, they will remain. It is possible that they may outgrow the surrounding grass and weeds. If they do, the shade produced by the greens will reduce the chance of grass growing near them. Red Romaine For about week in early December, we had temperatures in the upper 60s and low 70s for several days in a row. I believe that it was at this time that the red romaine decided to go from leafy mode to seed mode. When I first noticed this, I pulled the blooms off of the plant in hopes that it would switch back to leaf mode with the colder temperatures that followed. However, it did not and as a result the leaves are still narrow on the plant. Raised Beds The items that are in the raised beds that I set up in the spring of 2019 are not doing as well as the items that are in other containers or directly in the ground. I think this, in part, has to do with the fact that I put pine mulch in the raised beds in the beginning of the spring season. What I found out after I put the mulch down, was that pine mulch usually makes the soil acidic. I'm not sure how acidic it made the soil, but based on the articles that I read about it, it can lower the pH to 5 or 4 range. The tomatoes that grew in the same bed in the spring, did extremely well. However, the lettuce, cabbage, and greens that are currently in the bed are not doing as well. In some of the raised beds, I have added ashes from the firepit to the bed. The articles that I read suggested that by doing this, the soil will become more basic as the ashes break down. Weather The weather for the last couple of weeks has ranged from being close to freezing to the lower 70s on Christmas.

Not sure at this point whether I'm going to let them continue to grow in the grass or cut the grass and greens once the summer growing season starts. For now, they will remain. It is possible that they may outgrow the surrounding grass and weeds. If they do, the shade produced by the greens will reduce the chance of grass growing near them.","title":"Greens in the Grass"},{"location":"gardening/2019-12-29-greens-in-grass/#red-romaine","text":"For about week in early December, we had temperatures in the upper 60s and low 70s for several days in a row. I believe that it was at this time that the red romaine decided to go from leafy mode to seed mode.

I think this, in part, has to do with the fact that I put pine mulch in the raised beds in the beginning of the spring season. What I found out after I put the mulch down, was that pine mulch usually makes the soil acidic. I'm not sure how acidic it made the soil, but based on the articles that I read about it, it can lower the pH to 5 or 4 range. The tomatoes that grew in the same bed in the spring, did extremely well. However, the lettuce, cabbage, and greens that are currently in the bed are not doing as well. In some of the raised beds, I have added ashes from the firepit to the bed. The articles that I read suggested that by doing this, the soil will become more basic as the ashes break down.","title":"Raised Beds"},{"location":"gardening/2019-12-29-greens-in-grass/#weather","text":"The weather for the last couple of weeks has ranged from being close to freezing to the lower 70s on Christmas.

Normally lettuces and other leafy greens do well during the winter season due to the cooler temperatures and the occasional frost that controls bugs and sweetens the leaves. This winter season, we have experienced temperatures in the low and mid 70s for several days to a week at a time. That is definitely unseasonably warm, and as a result, all of the red lettuce and some of the green leaf lettuce bolted in the middle of December. I remove the flowers that were starting to appear when I first noticed the lettuce flowering and that got some of them back in check. However the red lettuce was committed to making flowers, so I removed it from the garden. It is currently in cue in the firepit so that it can dry out and be used back in the garden as compost. Onions I have a green onion that I planted several years ago. This winter, it has grown a lot bigger and taller than in years past while remaining in the same container. I did make a IG post about this particular plant and how big that it has gotten. The backstory about this particular onion, is that I got it from either Blue Apron or the grocery store. I do not recall which. If you watch videos or read articles about gardening, they will suggest that you do not use store bought fruits and vegetables in your garden as they will not do well. This onion plant has proved that to be far from the truth. Like any other plant, if you put it in the right environment and give it what it needs, it will grow and multiply. Collard and Mustard Greens Once I got to planting the leafy greens that I was going to grow for the season, I realized that I probably bought more than what I should have.

One of the recommendations to achieve this is to walk at least 10,000 steps per day, which equates to about 5 miles. Make note that with this recommendation, that you do not have to get all 5 miles done in a single setting or activity. The problem that I noticed was that I work a 9-5 desk job, and there\u2019s really no walking involved for that line of work. After researching and hearing about the consequences of sitting or lack of walking, I decided to make some adjustments to my habits to get more steps in per day. I have a phone and activity tracker that track the number of daily steps. On a typical day where I went from home to work to home without stopping anywhere else, I would log about 2,500 to 3,500 steps per day. That is way below the recommended 10,000 steps per day. So here\u2019s how I chose to try to gain more steps per day without hitting the treadmill or park. Hack 1) Park In The First Empty Spot If you really want some steps, park in the space that is closest to the road and not the store or restaurant that you are going into. Now personally I do not try to park at the door or ride around for finding the closest spot and I also do not park at the very end of the parking lot. Usually, I'll park in between the road and the store. The rule that I do follow is that I do not drive down more than two (2) aisles when looking for a parking space. Not only does riding around looking for the closest parking space waste gas, it also and reduce the number of steps that you get. This adds about 100-200 steps per occurrence. Hack 2) No Drive-Thrus If I go out to eat and the restaurant has a drive through, I skip it and go inside to the counter. Through trail and error from doing this, I have found that by going inside instead of going into the drive-thru, I\u2019m actually able to get in and out faster than those in the drive through. If you believe my experience is flawed, there is a survey that was done by QSR Magazine that stated that the drive-thru line wait time increased from 2013 to 2014 by 40 seconds. In addition, sitting in the drive through wastes gas unless you are driving an electric, hybrid, or auto-stop vehicle. Next time that you go to a fast-food restaurant, as you walk into the restaurant and take note of the last car that is in the drive through line and see if you walk out of the restaurant before the car gets out of the drive thru. This adds about 100-150 steps per occurrence. Hack 3) Take The Stairs If you have the option to take the stairs or the elevator, the default I recommend is to take the stairs. However, if there are no stairs then take the escalator and walk down it. Now if you work or live in a tall building and cannot take all the stairs to your floor, then go as many flights of steps that you can tolerate and take the elevator the rest of the way. This adds about 10-30 steps per floor. Hack 4) When You Gotta Go, Go Further At my job, the restroom is about 20 steps from my desk. The next closest restroom in the office building is about 75 steps, including a flight of stairs (see Hack 3). Just by going to another floor, that\u2019s almost 3 times the number of steps. Round trip, that is about 150 steps and traversing two flights of stairs. If your home has multiple stories with a bathroom on each, then when you have to use the bathroom, go to the bathroom on a floor that you are not on. If your home is single story, then go to the bathroom that is furthest from you or make multiple trips to and from where you are before you go. This adds about 110 steps at work and 40 at home each time that I go. Hack 5) Drink More Water I know what you are thinking\u2026 water has nothing to do with steps. Actually it does though. By drinking more water, you will go to the bathroom more often. When you go to the bathroom more often, then you can apply Hack 4 to get more steps. Before using this hack, I would probably go to the restroom once, sometimes twice, while at work. Now that I drink more water, I go at least two or more times per day. Each time I go, I apply Hack 3 and 4. Hack 6) Set Reminders, Pedometer Alerts I have a pedometer that I wear on my wrist. If it does not detect that I have taken any steps within the last hour, it will buzz and remind me to get some steps in. When it does go off and I am at work, I will get up to use the restroom (Hack 4), get some water (Hack 5), or talk to a coworker in person. If I am on a conference call when it goes off, I will stand up, stretch, and take some steps in my cubicle. The amount of steps this hack will add will vary. Hack 7) Walk Around Your Car Or House Before You Go In One day, I was waiting at a red light located near a fire station. I noticed some of the firefighters went around to the back of the fire house on the right side. After about 15 seconds, some firefighters came from the back of the firehouse on the left side. However, it was not the group that had gone around on the right. About another 10 more seconds, the group I saw that went around on the right side was coming around on the left side and it occurred to me that they were doing laps. Firefighters cannot leave the firehouse while on shift, because they have to respond when a call comes in, they ran laps around the firehouse as their physical activity. Applying this same strategy, I will sometimes walk around by car before getting in it or walk around my house before going inside. During the walk around the car, I pay attention to the tires and look for any scratch marks or dings that may have appears. When walking around the house, I look at the roof and exterior to see if anything significant has changed. This adds about 25 steps when walking around the car and about 150 steps when walking around the house per occurrence. The amount of steps this hack will add will vary. Conclusion By doing a combination of these hacks, I've been able to increase my minimal step range from 2500-3500 range to the 4000-5000 range. I know you think that is not a lot, but keep in mind that every step counts. Hopefully, this has inspired you to take small steps in adding steps to your day.

Sometimes, I do find myself getting stuck on building an automation. When it comes to programming, you can do an online search and find an example or the exact code for the thing that you are trying to program but cannot figure out how. However, there are times where the answer cannot be found on Stack Overflow. I know every programmer that is reading this probably had a facial reaction or yelled an expletive to the previous sentence, but it is true. I will admit, Stack Overflow does have a lot of the answers to the most common routine programming and computer questions, but there are still unknown unknowns that it does not have the answers to. In my younger programming days (you better not be laughing), I would keep trying different ways of accomplishing the programming task. This, continue working on it until you get it right approach, would work some of the time because I would become so focused on the program until I got it right. Things have changed since then. New technologies have taken over (Python gasp). New programmers are not following the common standards or the specific language, like starting Java functions with an upper case letter, or just coming up with their own standards and wonder why other programmers do not want to touch what they have created. One: You Get More Work Done With the automation team that I work with, we use JIRA for our task tracking. I put those JIRA tasks and the amount of time I spend on each task on my Outlook calendar, so that I can get a visual of how much time that I have spent on a given task in comparison to my week. By combining the visual from Outlook calendar and the Scrum Board from JIRA, I realized that I was completing fewer tasks in less time when I got stuck with a programming issue. Those of you familiar with Burn Down Rates and how it can impact a project will probably understand this the best. Staring at the round peg to see how you can get it in the square hole will not make the solution come by easier. If you know that you have other square pegs to place into square holes, then you can work on those and come back to the round peg and square hole. I have even completed lower priority tasks before higher priority tasks because I knew that I had or could reach the solution to that lower priority task faster than the higher priority task. Some project managers may balk at this approach. If they do, my recommendation would be to reference your Burn Down Rate so that they see that you are completing more tasks, although it may not be the high priority ones. Two: The Numbers Favor You The more that you are able to complete in given amount of time, the more valuable and productive that you appear. If your manager is only concerned with the numbers and not the science or reasoning behind the numbers, then this tip is great for you. Managers that only look at the numbers and not the data that supports the numbers think that things are going great because more tasks are getting completed. However, if you have 10 tasks that are to be completed within a sprint, and 5 of those are defects from crappy done work in a previous sprint, then you are really only completing 5 new items instead of 10, thus 50% new feature rate. Solely looking at the numbers may not convey this point depending on how it is presented. If your manager actually wants to know the science or reasoning behind the numbers, this will probably get you on the Naughty List. When I work on an automation, I design it in a way so that unless something major changes (e.g. API changes, new elements on a page, conversion to new technology), that automation will work correctly and has the intelligence to handle minor issues that may occur. That way I\u2019m truly completing the tasks assigned and not repeatedly patching defects or making small adjustments, thus reducing the number of new automations that I can complete. Three: Less Mental Fatigue and Strain Since I was not so dedicated with completing one single task before moving on to the next, I realized that I was able to complete the work without being as mentally drained at the end of the day. Programming does not require much physical effort as most programmers either stand or sit in one spot while they do their work. However the ability to be able to assemble things in a logical fashion takes a lot of mental effort.

Sometimes, I do find myself getting stuck on building an automation. When it comes to programming, you can do an online search and find an example or the exact code for the thing that you are trying to program but cannot figure out how. However, there are times where the answer cannot be found on Stack Overflow. I know every programmer that is reading this probably had a facial reaction or yelled an expletive to the previous sentence, but it is true. I will admit, Stack Overflow does have a lot of the answers to the most common routine programming and computer questions, but there are still unknown unknowns that it does not have the answers to. In my younger programming days (you better not be laughing), I would keep trying different ways of accomplishing the programming task. This, continue working on it until you get it right approach, would work some of the time because I would become so focused on the program until I got it right. Things have changed since then. New technologies have taken over (Python gasp). New programmers are not following the common standards or the specific language, like starting Java functions with an upper case letter, or just coming up with their own standards and wonder why other programmers do not want to touch what they have created.","title":"3 Benefits of Doing Something Different When Stuck"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-06-13-3-benefits-of-doing-something-different-when-stuck/#one-you-get-more-work-done","text":"With the automation team that I work with, we use JIRA for our task tracking. I put those JIRA tasks and the amount of time I spend on each task on my Outlook calendar, so that I can get a visual of how much time that I have spent on a given task in comparison to my week. By combining the visual from Outlook calendar and the Scrum Board from JIRA, I realized that I was completing fewer tasks in less time when I got stuck with a programming issue. Those of you familiar with Burn Down Rates and how it can impact a project will probably understand this the best. Staring at the round peg to see how you can get it in the square hole will not make the solution come by easier. If you know that you have other square pegs to place into square holes, then you can work on those and come back to the round peg and square hole. I have even completed lower priority tasks before higher priority tasks because I knew that I had or could reach the solution to that lower priority task faster than the higher priority task. Some project managers may balk at this approach. If they do, my recommendation would be to reference your Burn Down Rate so that they see that you are completing more tasks, although it may not be the high priority ones.","title":"One: You Get More Work Done"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-06-13-3-benefits-of-doing-something-different-when-stuck/#two-the-numbers-favor-you","text":"The more that you are able to complete in given amount of time, the more valuable and productive that you appear. If your manager is only concerned with the numbers and not the science or reasoning behind the numbers, then this tip is great for you. Managers that only look at the numbers and not the data that supports the numbers think that things are going great because more tasks are getting completed. However, if you have 10 tasks that are to be completed within a sprint, and 5 of those are defects from crappy done work in a previous sprint, then you are really only completing 5 new items instead of 10, thus 50% new feature rate. Solely looking at the numbers may not convey this point depending on how it is presented. If your manager actually wants to know the science or reasoning behind the numbers, this will probably get you on the Naughty List. When I work on an automation, I design it in a way so that unless something major changes (e.g. API changes, new elements on a page, conversion to new technology), that automation will work correctly and has the intelligence to handle minor issues that may occur. That way I\u2019m truly completing the tasks assigned and not repeatedly patching defects or making small adjustments, thus reducing the number of new automations that I can complete.","title":"Two: The Numbers Favor You"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-06-13-3-benefits-of-doing-something-different-when-stuck/#three-less-mental-fatigue-and-strain","text":"Since I was not so dedicated with completing one single task before moving on to the next, I realized that I was able to complete the work without being as mentally drained at the end of the day.

That is not a fair, nor equal comparison by no means. The comparisons mentioned below are for the sake of illustration and for laughter. Background I'm sure you have seen the image above floating around on social media. A restaurant in Arkansas decided to add this add-on to their menu for those women that claim that they aren't hungry, but deep down, they would devour everything in the restaurant. Before this image went viral, I found a way to save that additional $4 on food that I'm not even going to eat. Believe it or not, what I am about to share with you, I learned it from gardening. Now this article is written for the men, but obviously I cannot prevent a woman from reading or sharing it. Now gentlemen, these steps will only work if you have a greater and diverse taste pallet than your lady. Do not be afraid to become diverse when it comes to food. So here's how I keep a woman from eating off my plate... Step 1: Learn What She Does Not Eat Or Is Allergic To The first year I got serious about gardening, I planted a combination of fruits and vegetables that I wanted to eat during the growing season. This resulted in me caring for bunch of green leaves and no fruit. Talking about disappointment... it was major. So after doing some research about squirrels, I found that their diet consists of mostly of nuts and small fruit. I had to make a choice... grow the food that squirrels and I both love so much and fight them to eat it, or grow something that I love and that the squirrels hate. Since I'm responsible for maintaining the garden, growing what the squirrels did not eat became the priority. In the end, I did not have to protect my garden with Fort Knox security because they were not attracted to what was in the garden. To apply this step to women, find out what she does not eat or is allergic to. There are several ways that you can figure this out. Just ask. She may tell you everything. She may tell you only part of the list. Whatever she tells you, be sure to make note of it. Check the pantry. That's right... go in her pantry or cabinets. You have to decide whether you want to be discrete about it or not. If you do not see beans in her cabinet, that's probably on the Do Not Eat List. Watch what she eats. If y'all go to a restaurant that is known for burgers, and she orders chicken, then there is a great chance that she does not eat beef. If she orders French Fries with Ranch, then she probably does not eat ketchup. If she orders the vegan shrimp tacos, then she probably does not eat actual meat. Step 2: When Eating, Order The Items You Have Identified From Step 1 With my knowledge of the squirrel diet, I revamped my garden to include jalapeno peppers, lettuce, and turnip greens. After planting these items, I rarely saw a squirrel near the garden or in the yard. Why? They weren't attracted to what was there. Thus staying away and looking else where. Now there are times where Step 2 may not fully work. That's when you still order what you want, but modify it accordingly. For instance... You like chicken, your lady likes chicken, and your lady hates BBQ sauce. Pour BBQ sauce on the chicken. Problem solved. You order a salad, your lady likes salads, your lady also likes Ranch dressing, but your lady does not eat Ranch dressing on her salad. Order a salad with Ranch dressing... and coat it thoroughly. Problem solved. You go to a seafood restaurant, your lady likes shrimp and does not like spicy food. Order shrimp and cover it with hot sauce. Problem solved. If she always orders Papa Johns', then you order Domino's or Pizza Hut. Problem solved. Step 3: Check The Reaction When squirrels are scouting the area, they will look and stand on their hind legs or climb a tree to get a better field of view. When they cannot find what they think they saw, they continue digging and looking and digging and looking. Eventually they will give up and look elsewhere for food. Before a woman swipes... I mean steals food off of your plate, she will do an analysis of what you have on your plate with or without your prior knowledge. Think of it like Robocop walking down the street and he is analyzing each person's face to see if he or she is the individual matching a suspects description. Instead of faces being scanned, it is the food on your plate. Scanning baked beans... will cause gas... skipping. Scanning potato salad... does not have boiled eggs... skipping. Scanning mac and cheese... it has raisins in it... skipping. Scanning chicken wings... confirming it has lemon pepper seasoning... TAKE IT, TAKE IT. Now if she scans your entire plate and does not find anything that appeals to her taste buds, she will make a comment about that fact. You may hear one or more of the following phrases accompanied with an unpleasant facial expression: \"I don't see how you eat that stuff.\" \"I don't need none of that.\" \"You know eating insert food name is not good for you.\" If you hear any of the preceding phrases or something similar, you sir have successfully saved your food from being stolen. Conclusion Ladies, you have to understand that there is nothing more satisfying to a man than to be able to order what he wants and knowing that he will be able to clean the entire plate. When a lady eats from a man's plate, he will not get full because of the fact she has reduced the portion size. Thus he has to venture to the kitchen or some other place for a midnight snack because he was deprived of calories. As previously mentioned, these steps can only be achieved if you have a greater diversity in your taste pallet than your lady. Lacking this essential trait, means that you will never be successful eating your entire plate if she is around. These are just my thoughts.","title":"Squirrels Taught Me About Women and Food"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-07-03-squirrels-taught-me-about-women-and-food/#squirrels-taught-me-about-women-and-food","text":"DISCLAIMER: I am not equating a squirrel to a woman.

Therefore, I took 28 days to see what would happen. Was I trying to overachieve by doing more than what was necessary? Nah. Initially, it was going to be 21 Days of Prayer that my church. It was coincidence that part of the 21 Days of Prayer was overlapped by the 21 Days of Miraculous Meditation done by Deepak Chopra. Combine this with the dating/relationship issues that I had and the certification course that was about to start for the next 4 weeks and it was almost like I walking into a season of turmoil. So what habits did I choose to do for this season that I saw myself entering? I have about 15-20 items on the habits list. I am not going to cover them all and the impact that they had as this post would be unreasonably long. Habit 1: Ride with the Radio Off Not the volume turned all the way down, but I actually pressed the power button and turned it off. In order to not make things awkward when I had passengers, I did turn the radio on while they were riding. Once they got out, radio went back off. 1) You may more attention to what is going on around you while you drive. You would not believe how many folks drive with their cell phones in their hand. Well you probably do. One thing that I did notice, is that a lot of the drivers that I saw with phones in their hand(s), had damage to their right front bumper and headlight area. From watching Canada's Worst Driver , they stated that a lot of drivers usually hit something on the passenger side more than the driver side. Makes sense as most drivers would not put themselves in danger when they have full control. In addition, most people drift to the right in their lane instead of the left as drifting left will put you into oncoming traffic on rural and residential roads. 2) You can think without being interrupted. When your song gets played on the radio, you know the one that I am talking about that makes you turn the radio up on blast and have a one man/woman choir, it distracts you from what you were previously thinking about or interrupts the conversation that you were having with your passengers. Traffic report comes on, you focus on what is being said to make sure there are no accidents in the direction that you are headed. With the radio off, you can figure out that programming problem, replay a conversation back and figure out why you said what you said, or if you believe in an higher power to pray. Habit 2: Eat Meat Once Per Day Maximum I know you are saying that that is impossible to do. It actually is very possible to do. The habit with this is that I could eat as much meat as I wanted, but it had to be consumed within a single meal or snack. Depending on where you live, it may be harder to do in some places than others. Where I live, there are not many vegan or vegetarian only restaurants, but there are restaurants that do offer vegan and vegetarian options. One side effect was that my bathroom habits changed. I realized that meat slows down my digestion, so when I would eat a large amount of meat, I would not \u201cgo\u201d as often. For me, it involved a lot of thinking ahead about what I was going to eat. It also involved taking a lunch everyday\u2026 yes single day\u2026 instead of going out for lunch. Some days, that meant I ate a big bowl of oatmeal for lunch as I didn\u2019t cook dinner the night before. Habit 3: Pack A Lunch During the month of August, I had many expenses come up. Vehicle registration, having tress cut, new car battery after the previous gave out unexpectedly, home repairs\u2026 it was a lot. I calculated the amount that I had spent on going out to eat during the month of July. It totaled to about $75 or the equivalent of 1.5 tanks of gas. When I started looking more intently at the non-essential things that I was spending my money on and converting that to the financial equivalent of the essentials that I was spending my money on, it put things into a greater perspective financially that I was really living at my means. So by cutting back on takeout and going out to eat, I was able to divert those funds to things that would bring me a greater sense of accomplishment, like doing handy work or my own car repairs or making financial investments with the savings. Habit 4: Work It Out One of the ways to reduce stress is to work out. So I made a commitment to myself to do Focus T25 or Wii Sports a couple of times per week. Now I did not follow the T25 workout plan as it was designed given that I did not have the time to be able to do so. My strategy was that some workout is better than no workout. Was I sore the first week of consistently doing Wii and T25? Yes. Almost to the point that I would rather sit or lay down than stand up. Did I feel a change in my body and level of energy? Yup. Conclusion Now I am not saying that what I have done will work for you. Everybody is different and has their own way of dealing with the complexities of life. That said, consider this post as a guide for what you can do for your 21+ day habit changing, fasting or prayer. These are just my thoughts.","title":"21 Days for a New Habit"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-08-15-21-days-for-a-new-habit/#21-days-for-a-new-habit","text":"","title":"21 Days for a New Habit"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-08-15-21-days-for-a-new-habit/#background","text":"They say that it takes 21 days to learn a new habit and to break old ones.

This week's particular movie was \"Disney's Christopher Robin\". As I was in church, watching this message and movie, it spoke to me given the number of changes that were taking place in my life. SPOILER ALERT: I do mention scenes from the movie. So if you have not watched the movie yet and hate spoilers, go watch the movie before reading this article. Things That I Got From This Movie Doing Nothing Often Leads To The Very Best Of Something Picture a tree in a forest. That tree seed landed on the ground and took root. Usually there\u2019s nothing any human has to do as the tree will be able to sustain itself unless something else takes place like a natural disaster (flood, forest fire) or human intervention (land clearing, improper trimming of tree). By nobody doing anything to that tree, the tree is able to provide oxygen for mammals to breathe, habitat for the animals of the forest, and shade to the animals and humans that visit the forest. This is a quote that is repeated many times in the movie. Majority of the movie, Christopher Robin spends time trying to work on making efficiency improvements for his employer. Then at the end of the movie, he took one look at the paper his daughter handed him upside down and he came up with the best idea for cutting company costs. Sometimes not doing or saying anything, causes God or others to intervene on our behalf. Think of this as not repaying evil with evil. When You Get Lost, You Need To Reset There\u2019s a song, called \"Holy Ghost Power\" by the Chicago Mass Choir. Part of the chorus of that song says \"Go back to the altar; Down on your knees; Stay there 'til you get the Holy Ghost power\". This is one example of resetting your faith. It is believed that if you go to the altar and pray, that you\u2019ll be renewed and forgiven. Another example of this would be when you lose your keys and you backtrack your steps in order to find them. In the movie, Pooh walked into the tree that Christopher Robin previously lived and ended up in London. Pooh was at this point lost because he did not know where he was. However, Christopher Robin did know where he was, so Christopher Robin took Pooh back to Sussex and onward to the Hundred Acre Wood. In essence, Pooh was reset. By resetting, you are able to go where things are familiar, look at the path that you previously took, and then start a new path knowing that the existing path led you to a bad result. We Are Not Who We Used To Be. Sometimes We Become Lost The smartest of people make mistakes. We are all human. When a bridge failure or airplane malfunction occurs, often the maintainers and engineers get the blame. The investigators often go back to the original drawings and design to see if there were any miscalculations, typos, or other errors that were overlooked. Once those errors are identified, they are corrected so that they do not occur again. Whether it be redrawing the bridge or redesigning a component of the plane, it has now become better and it is not what it used to be. In the movie, this was reflected by Christopher Robin going back to the Hundred Acre Wood. Once there and Christopher Robin had to show the other inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood that he was indeed Christopher Robin as they last remembered him being a young boy and not a man. I like to refer to this as \"growth and development\". Find What Makes You Happy In the movie, Christopher Robin and Pooh are at the train station trying to catch the train to take Pooh back home. Pooh sees a balloon stand and says that he wants a balloon. Christopher initially says no but then gives in after Pooh mentions that the balloon will bring him happiness. Getting big things and dreams accomplished do bring us happiness, but sometimes it is the small things that can bring us the most happiness. For me, that would mean being in the presence of others, also known as quality time, that brings the greatest amount of happiness. Conclusion Everything happens for a reason. For me, it felt like perfect timing as these takeaway points and more are steps that I need to take to go forward in life.","title":"Takeaways from Christopher Robin movie"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-11-24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie","text":"Every year during the month of November, the church that I attend does a series where movies are used to provide examples and metaphors of the Word. This week's particular movie was \"Disney's Christopher Robin\". As I was in church, watching this message and movie, it spoke to me given the number of changes that were taking place in my life. SPOILER ALERT: I do mention scenes from the movie. So if you have not watched the movie yet and hate spoilers, go watch the movie before reading this article.","title":"Takeaways from Christopher Robin movie"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-11-24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#things-that-i-got-from-this-movie","text":"","title":"Things That I Got From This Movie"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-11-24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#doing-nothing-often-leads-to-the-very-best-of-something","text":"Picture a tree in a forest. That tree seed landed on the ground and took root. Usually there\u2019s nothing any human has to do as the tree will be able to sustain itself unless something else takes place like a natural disaster (flood, forest fire) or human intervention (land clearing, improper trimming of tree). By nobody doing anything to that tree, the tree is able to provide oxygen for mammals to breathe, habitat for the animals of the forest, and shade to the animals and humans that visit the forest. This is a quote that is repeated many times in the movie. Majority of the movie, Christopher Robin spends time trying to work on making efficiency improvements for his employer. Then at the end of the movie, he took one look at the paper his daughter handed him upside down and he came up with the best idea for cutting company costs. Sometimes not doing or saying anything, causes God or others to intervene on our behalf. Think of this as not repaying evil with evil.","title":"Doing Nothing Often Leads To The Very Best Of Something"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-11-24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#when-you-get-lost-you-need-to-reset","text":"There\u2019s a song, called \"Holy Ghost Power\" by the Chicago Mass Choir. Part of the chorus of that song says \"Go back to the altar; Down on your knees; Stay there 'til you get the Holy Ghost power\". This is one example of resetting your faith. It is believed that if you go to the altar and pray, that you\u2019ll be renewed and forgiven. Another example of this would be when you lose your keys and you backtrack your steps in order to find them. In the movie, Pooh walked into the tree that Christopher Robin previously lived and ended up in London. Pooh was at this point lost because he did not know where he was. However, Christopher Robin did know where he was, so Christopher Robin took Pooh back to Sussex and onward to the Hundred Acre Wood. In essence, Pooh was reset. By resetting, you are able to go where things are familiar, look at the path that you previously took, and then start a new path knowing that the existing path led you to a bad result.","title":"When You Get Lost, You Need To Reset"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-11-24-takeaways-from-christopher-robin-movie/#we-are-not-who-we-used-to-be-sometimes-we-become-lost","text":"The smartest of people make mistakes.

As you can imagine, the course is designed for Canadians, but I found that the concepts, ideas, and terminology could be applied to individuals in other countries. I was able to complete the course in about 4-5 hours (I did it all on Christmas Eve). The article that was written about the course, gives more insight into what the course is about and who it is designed for. Once you complete the course, you will receive a certificate of completion. Feel free to read the article . Below are my notes from the course. They are not well structured, but I did make an effort to note the key points that were mentioned in each section. I have also included my test results from each section in case you want to compare your results to mine. For each section, you have to get 80% or greater in order to pass each module. I would encourage you to take the course for yourself even if you are good with money. I consider myself to be good with money, but did not realize until I got to Module 8 that there is a psychological aspect to how well or bad you are with money and investing. Module 1, Intro No notes from this section. No test for this section. Module 2, Debt and Borrowing Common Sources of Debt understand what sources of credit are most appropriate terms and conditions for the type of debt Credit Cards are easier to obtain rewards and benefits look at the fees and interest rates a card may have a high rate, but the benefits can outweigh the rate Lines of Credit operates similar to checking account as it gives debit cards or is connected to checks it accrues interest immediately usually has lower fees and interest rates than credit cards people often usually take out a larger balance for line of credit than for credit cards as they have lower rates Long Term Financing usually used for larger costs assets, cars, or houses if you don't pay for it in full, then the asset is repossessed the asset is collateral Mortgages used specifically for buying a home minimum down payment is usually required, 5% to 20% down payment cant be used from other sources, like line of credit mortgage loan insurance covers the lender in case you default a change of the mortgage term will require agreement between the two parties involved loans are amortized type of interest rate is a consideration. mortgage payments stay the same with fixed rates. However variable rates will cause your payment amount to go up. time and interest are impacted by the mount of payments made during the repayment period Credit Scores Credit Worthiness Credit history is used and based on credit report. Like a report card and how responsible you are includes debt sent to collections, bankruptcy, usually stay on report for 6 years, but may stay on longer positive info, like making on time payments, may stay on longer math formula is used to calculate the score; from 300-900 (in Canada) factors include how long you have had credit for, outstanding balances, missed payments, amount of outstanding debts, if debts have been sent to collections, being close to the credit limit, times you've tried to get more credit, record of insolvency or bankruptcy good credit gives you preferential interest rates check your credit report regularly Rules for Borrowing live within your means always use debt wisely need a solid plan for repaying debt before getting it Passed with 80% score. Module 3, Your Money Today and Tomorrow Time value of money - the amount of money is wroth more the sooner it is received Compounding allows you to earn interest on interest present value and future value fv = pv * (1 + r)^t fv = 100 * (1 + 0.04)^2 fv = 108.16 the higher interest rate or greater number of periods, the higher the future value can only compare values at the same point in time IF they are not at the same point in time, then you have to bring them to the same point in time Discounting money traveling backwards in time, it is called Discounting; the reverse of compounding pv = fv / (1 + r)^t pv = 104 / (1 + 0.04)^1 pv = 100 Everyday Applications doing investments in installments will earn more interest than a lump sum doing payments in chunks, less interest is charged on the remaining balance I passed with a 90%. Module 4, Strategic Budget Building need to have a budget budgets also deal with the time value of money Why Budget budget is estimate of income and expenditures over a given period of time cash in vs cash out you want to have a surplus, more income than expenditures process of budget helps achieve goals Tips and Techniques structured planning approach Preparing kick off meeting; write 1-3 words where you stand financially write 1-3 words where you like to be 1-3 years from now, balance ambition and reason include a vision statement write 5 biggest challenges to achieving budget goals include information that you need to stand where you are and where you would like to be supplementary material is available for the course have stakeholders involved to help you achieve your goals in the future; important to have those connections established Analyzing make fact-based decisions calculate your revenue and expenditures use the revenue tool that is available Deciding finalize the 3-year vision strategies to overcome the challenges and achieve the vision look back at the vision statement, adjust it as needed; should be 1-2 sentences refine the vision based on the challenges identified 5-7 ways to overcome the challenges to be able to achieve the vision Keys Steps to Budgeting achieving quick wins list 3 things that will get done in 2-3 months to achieve goals use KPIs to track progress; come up with 3-5 key areas (bank balance, investments, etc) if you get behind on your KPI, then adjust and keep going Key takeaways annual budget is important have a vision where you want to be in 3 years review budget throughout the year new budgets celebrate successes Passed section with 100%. Module 5, The Art of Investing, Part 1 Investment Options need to know the difference between stocks and bonds stocks are very risky bonds are IOUs, more secure you make money from a bond via the interest money market = bonds less than 1 year bonds promise a fixed income long term bonds have more risk than short term companies bonds are more risky than government bonds bonds are less risky than stocks stocks usually have higher returns, 8% on average bear vs bull markets how to invest open brokerage account mutual funds have professionals that invest on investors behalf active mutual funds adjust over time passive mutual funds just follow the market, usually are cheaper than active the earlier you start investing, the better Common Mistakes and Rules to Avoid Them Diversification most investors repeat the same mistakes s and p 500 index - large 500 stocks in the market, gives an overall picture of the performance of the stock market compare the stocks to the S and P and it is less volatile diversification doesn't eliminate every kind of risk , value can still go down if there is bad news about the entire economy how do you diversify maximizing by including every kind of industry in your portfolio invest in index funds, buys multiple funds ; they don't trade a lot also invest internationally diversification doesn't protect from market crashes usually the market recovers from crashes; thus the high risk for stocks the dot com boom the .coms got to high levels and then the bubble popped learn from the mistakes of others buy low, sell high; basic rule for making money of the market most people do the opposite should be expected that there will be more than one financial crisis in your lifetime keep investing when markets are depressed markets usually recover from crashes after a few years minimize investment expenses the more the trade, some have worse experiences investment expense should be controlled; find low costs investments investing fess make a big difference when it comes to compounding if your money you will get less over time, in some cases by half summary diversified portfolio don't buy low and sell high ; mood of the market keep investing when things look bad minimize investment expenses be cautious when market becomes excited about a company or invention that will \"change the world\" Failed with 70% first time Passed with 90% second time Module 6, The Art of Investing, Part 2 Progressive Income Tax in Canada Doesn't apply to be since I'm in the US, so I didn't take notes on this. Considering Income Tax when Investing investment income is taxed on top of your regular income Paying Down Debt interest saved on debts are not taxed paying personal debt should be considered first Government incentives Information in this section is specific to Canada. However it does describes in a similar nature of how retirement accounts work in the US. From what I can gather is TFSA = Roth 401K or Roth IRA RRSP = Traditional 401K Failed with 60% on first attempt Passed with 100% on second attempt Module 7, The Realities of Real Estate Why Real Estate? capital appreciation provides a sense of security can use it as leverage to borrow money can use it to reduce taxes value of real estate, the market usually keeps up with inflation but can go down with economic down turns Factors to Consider location population and income growth growing cities need more housing and provide a stable stream of income, and more capital appreciation Detroit is used as an example macro factors more people will buy houses when mortgages when rates go down constraints play a factor, such as the higher cost of living micro factors where and what you want to buy up and coming neighborhood or established neighborhood what do you want to buy? price and in relation to the size of the property consider age of the building Housing Affordability and Rent vs Buy Decision know whether you can afford a house or not in your current state spend no more than 28% to 36% of your income on housing house to rent ratio ;some cases means that it is better to rent than to buy price to rent ratio = price of property / annualized rent alternative ways to invest in real estate invest in REITs (real estate investment trusts) REITs can have different property types. usually are very good Failed with 70% on first attempt Passed with 80% on second attempt Module 8, Behavioral Finance cross between psychology and finance investor irrationality What Kind of Investor Are You? risk aversion risk aversion - how much do you dislike risk most investors are risk averse there are different levels of risk aversion less risk would be treasury bills, gics higher risk would be stocks there is no true way to assess risk aversion risk aversion factors investors level of wealth - wealthy investors can take on more risk age - younger investors can afford to take on more risk can recover from bad mistakes based on future income and being able to bounce back over time personal situation and liquidity needs personality - some worry more than others. some don't worry enough. Thus it factors in to how much each person is willing to risk. Psychological Mistakes emotions can impact investment decisions Behavioral Biases - observed tendency for some to make mistakes biases conservatism bias - under react to new information, incorporate prior information representativeness - similar to stereotypes; over-extrapolation of long trends disposition effect - sell stocks in their portfolio that work well and hold under-performing stocks; often related to a state of denial biased self attribution - attribute their success to their own skill when they are making money, but claim bad luck when things go wrong fear - fear has impact related to the risk you are willing to take; avoid making financial decisions when in a high emotional state three stages of grief denial anger bargaining Investment Strategies trading strategies momentum trading - invest in stocks that have done well over the past year related to conservatism bias; the market can be slow to react to the news, thus a delay in reaching its true value post-earnings announcement drift - continue drifting in the initial direction after the initial announcement; related to the conservatism bias; results in the stock price not increasing as good as it should Passed with 80% on first attempt","title":"McGill University Personal Finance Essentials"},{"location":"lifestyle/2019-12-26-mcgill-university-personal-finance-essentials/#mcgill-university-personal-finance-essentials","text":"A friend on social media posted about this online financial course that is available for free from McGill University in Canada.

Of course I asked about why she chose the word that she chose and her response was rather motivating that I ought to do the same to set myself on a better trajectory for the year. I have to be honest thought. I had never heard of a yearly word concept. After doing some online research, skipping over the number of articles that talked about Merriam-Websters word of 2019 (which was \"them\"), I found out that this has been a thing since 2006 . Who knew? Some articles suggested picking a word for each quarter of the year. Thinking of 4 words for 12 months was a bit more difficult as I struggled to decide on one word for the entire 12 months. Eventually I did decide on a word. Here is how I went through the process of determining a word for the year. Make a List I started by making a list of words that I thought would be the most relevant for me this year, that highlight things that I did not get quite right last year, and something that I knew I could stick to. After some debate, and online research, I came up with the following list: dominate leadership create elevate relationships Each word has a back story in how it made it to the list. Dominate I started a new job a couple of months ago. One of the major things about this job, is that it has required me to learn technology that I have not worked with in almost a decade. Given this significant shift, I want to be very great at it coming out of the gate. I remember watching \"Storm Chasers\" back in the day and during some of the episodes, Reed Timmer would say \"dominate, dominate, dominate\" over and over again while they were chasing tornadoes. I felt that by him saying the word over and over and over again, it reinforced his drive to seek out, find storms, and to be able to chase better than most that had been in the industry longer than him. Leadership If you have read any of John Maxwell's books, you know all he talks about is being a leader. Being a leader does not mean that you have to be at the top. It does mean that you can motivate and obtain followers where you currently are. Demonstrating leadership can help you get to the top. Create As you may know, I have a YouTube channel where I show viewers how to do projects that they might be considering or how to do something when it comes to technology (after all I do work in IT). However, my channel has not been as successful as I would like it to be. The reasoning behind this word, was to create better and more content than I have in years past. In doing so, I would hope that I would increase my subscriber base and following. Elevate Seeing the potential in others can make them feel better in their worse time. I do believe that we are called to be able to support each other when we have the resources to be able to do so. In turn, those that support will get support for their efforts. Relationships I had a dating relationship that failed in the previous year over differences in opinion. Also had some friendships that kicked the can as well. Having those relationships end was never the end goal, but here I am. Also, I am an introvert. Most introverts do not have large friendship circles or networks, mostly because it takes so much energy to maintain those circles. However, I do have a desire to engage and interact more with others despite my introverted ways. My Word for 2020 After much contemplation, I chose \"relationships\" as my word for 2020. I realized that relationships are the key or foundation to each one of the other words in my list. dominate - While it is possible to dominate on your own, it is easier to and better do it with a team. One of the main examples of this was Reed Timmer. He and his team of storm chasers would follow storms for several days and weeks on end. Without those relationships, you cannot have a dominate. leadership - In order to be a leader, you have to have a relationship with the people that you are going to lead. create - Those that create digital content, do it in part because of the relationships that you can build with others online. Without those relationships of interacting with people, the content that individuals create would be useless. elevate - Connect with people before you correct people. Being able to build others up is a good skill. From my experience, in order to be able to improve the lives of others, you have to have a positive relationship with those individuals. Conclusion Hopefully this article has inspired you to come up with a word for the year in effort to better achieve your goals.","title":"Word of the Year"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020-01-03-word-of-the-year/#word-of-the-year-2020","text":"","title":"Word of the Year 2020"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020-01-03-word-of-the-year/#background","text":"A friend was telling me that she had chose a word for the year.

For the past two years, I have given up something during the fasting season and kept track of it on my Trello board. This year, I have decided that I would blog about my experience and results from fasting. My goal is to update this post each day with the updates for that particular day. Why 21 days? It has been said that if you commit to doing or not doing something for 21 days in a row, that it will become a habit and you will be more inclined to continue doing or not doing it beyond the 21 days. I did a fast last year for 21 days and some of those habits have stuck. Updates I will be posting my daily updates here so that you can follow along in my progress. Perhaps you have your own fast that you want to consider doing for the start of the year. Day 0 - January 4 I know what you are thinking... why is he starting to count with 0 instead of 1? Computers start their counting of items with 0. However, humans usually start with 1, so programmers like myself have to add additional code in so that the counting will be acceptable to humans. Consider this day to be the day of preparation before entering the fast. My goals during this fast are to do the following: No Facebook Social media is addictive. Main reason that I am avoiding Facebook is because I login to that website more than the other social media accounts that I have. I did see a post that said to not use social media less but to use it more intently. That post is the header graphic of this post. I do plan on doing this more after the fast is over. For the fast though, I have found that when I cut out the most addictive social media habits, that I am able to do more of the things that I previously have put off to the side. Daily Commits to Github As part of my personal branding strategy, I want to actually demonstrate that I do participate in the IT community and provide digital contributions. That said, I plan on contributing to making at least one commit to any of my repositories per day during the fast. I know it seems excessive, but hear (or read) me out on this. Not all of my commits will be code related. The version control for my blog is on Github, so some of those commits will be new or updated content for my website. Other commits will be new or updated code that I have done. No Meat, Little to No Cheese I have refrained from eating meat in the past. There were some noticable differences such as having a flatter stomach, going to The John more frequently, and being more energetic. In addition, I have watched documentaries that state that eating too much meat can have a negative impact on your body. When it comes to cheese, I have noticed that eating a lot of it can change my regularity. Since the last fast, I have gotten away from eating it sparingly. Thus I want to get back in that habit of not eating it as frequently. Journal Daily I have discovered in recent months that there is something about writing your thoughts and ideas out. Yes, there is the scripture in Habakkuk about writing the vision and making it plan. I also think that journaling allows us to clear our heads from the things that we want to remember, but do not necessarily need to always keep readily on our minds. In other words, it allows you to \"clean out the attic\". I listened to a podcast one time, at the speaker was mentioning that we perceive the brain as more of a hard drive (i.e. permenant storage), when in actuality it is more like RAM (temporary storage). If you do not clean up the RAM periodically, then you will run into problems. On Linux systems, if you fill up the temporary storage, the OS might crash. Two Day Rule for Exercising Matt D'Avella posted a video about what he refers to as the Two Day Rule. What is the Two Day Rule? In short, the rule is that you do not go more than two days between doing a workout. I have done this in the past, outside of a fasting period, and do agree that it does motivate you to be in better shape and allows you to have days off if your schedule does not allow workout time. For my implementation of the Two Day Rule, does not mean always working out. Sometimes I will substitute a true workout with a 30 minute walk, or a hike, or some other sort of physical activity. Water, Tea, or Natural Juices As I have gotten older, I rarely drink sodas. During this fasting season, I am going to make an effort to not drink anything that may contain High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) as a lot of products contain this substance. They say that HFCS is fine to consume in moderation. Only problem that I have is... 1) What is \"moderation\"? Is it once per week, once per quarter, once per year? 2) It is hard to have something in moderation, when it is contained in majority of the food and drink that we consume. Daily Prayer As if this was obvious enough... heck it is in the title of the post. Day 1 - January 5 Today I had no meat. Went to Chipotle for lunch and an Indian restaurant for dinner. I only had water and tea to drink today. I spent the morning of today serving at church, so had to get up slightly earlier than normal. However, I was able to take a nap after the church services. I interacted with others about this and my previous post regarding my word of the year . It was very enlightening to hear about others' doing the same thing as myself, but for their personal benefit and mental health. I did not get around to exercising. Definitely is a must for tomorrow though. I did refrain from Facebook. I made a post yesterday on IG and Twitter, so I responded to messages and comments regarding those. I did find myself mindlessly scrolling, which I am trying to get out of the habit of. Once I realized that I was doing it, I redirected my focus to being more productive. Day 2 - January 6 Only had one real meal today and that was lunch. Had the remaining Chipotle from yesterday with some chips, Nutty Buddy bar, and a muffin. As I write this at 8 PM, I don't feel hungry, although I could eat. Was up earlier than normal today. I took that time to write in the journal and to do some reflecting, and map out some goals for the year. I prefer to set goals instead of make resolutions. While the two terms are similar in context, their definitions are different. My understanding after hearing and seeing people fail with keeping their resolutions, is that their resolutions should be broken down into smaller steps (i.e. goals). I have goals that I set last year that have not been accomplished. Those goals carried over into the new year in addition to the new ones that I have set for this year. I have found recipes in one of the crock pot cookbooks that I have. I have already had to modify them as they call for meat. Photos will be posted in the days to come an whether I would make them again or if I need to donate that cookbook to the local library. Day 3 - January 7 Was able to get a walk around the block in today. Could have walked an additional block as I did not do a walk yesterday. Made lemonade from scratch for the first time. It definitely has the lemon kick in it. Will need to use less lemons next time. Watched a sermon that was sent to me titled \"Looking Back, Keep Sitting, or Moving Forward\". It was a good message as it talked about how that we all have a past. However we are not to focus on the past, but instead use the past as a lesson for what to and not to do in the future. One of the examples given was that if you are standing and facing forward, that you are not aware of what is going on behind you. The scripture that supports this, was Joshua 1:1-6. I have also been watching some videos on how to be better web developer. These videos talk about pricing your services, to building your portfolio, to developing a system that works for you. I feel that these practices that I am learning can be applied to the work that I do. Day 4 - January 8 I actually managed to sleep a full night last night. Not sure why that was the case. It could possibly be because of the lack of meat in my diet, thus changing my body chemistry. Who knows? Surprisingly, I have been able to keep up with daily commits to this post and to Github as I have set out to do. I updated one of the sites that I had not updated in over a year. It had a number of security patches that needed to go in. In addition, the automated deployment script that I had created, was not working because of the execute permissions not being set (doggone Linux). Walking during lunch breaks is a good thing as it allows me to get in the recommended 10K steps per day. However, I do need some shoes that are intended for walking such distances during lunch break, as the dress shoes that I normally wear are clearly not cut out for that job. Day 5 - January 9 I listened to a sermon that talked about letting the past be the past, and to focus on what is to come in the future. I have been listening to more sermons recently, and this seems to be a common theme among them. These sermons were all delivered around the end of 2019. Watched some videos today, that had me thinking about some side income ideas that I could use to advance and extend my skillset in the IT field. I have watched several videos about people that are using Fiverr to make income. I used Fiverr back in 2011, but had not really be active on the platform recently. I figured that I could use platforms like these, to build automations to make the turnaround time for some of the requests faster thus reducing the manual amount of work required on my part. Day 11 - January 16 I have been sick the last few days. Managed to catch the flu. I am still in the recovery phase as I write this. This is part of the reason why there is a gap of about a week between updates. During this time, I have managed to go outside during the daytime, weather permitting, and capture some sunlight. Being in the house all day quarantining yourself because of doctor's orders is no fun, but it is a necessary precaution. Not sure who found out that sunlight helps elevate your mood, but I do have to agree. I would say that it was like boost of energy. Not quite like the boost that Popeye gets after eating a can of Spinach, but more like never riding a bike before and once you get on the bike realizing the purpose of the training wheels. I have been told many of times how my post about squirrels taught me about women and food is insanely funny. I did not realize that it would catch on in the way that it did, but I am glad that I can share my story with others and they get something out of it. I have gotten through almost entire week of ASP.Net Core MVC training. What that means is that I can build enterprise grade applications that will run a multiple platforms. This is definitely a useful skill that I am glad that I am able to add to my toolbelt. To my surprise, I have only missed 2 out of 11 days thus far, making a commit to any of my repositories on Github. Having a blog that is versioned on Github has helped with this cause. Also having requests for me to share knowledge about Python and Linux have added to the commits. Those of you that have requested such info, thanks! Day 12 - January 17 Completed training for ASP.Net Core MVC. The training is related to projects that I will be working on in the future. It was good to get training and some exposure to the subject prior to actually having to work with it. I did practice some courses and performing tutorials that I was able to find on YouTube and PluralSight courses. Day 19 - January 23 The fast is almost over. Did have a moment today where the lunch option provided had meat, but I did remove it from the sandwich was provided. Coworker informed me of a challenge that he has chosen to take up for this year. He said that hi grandson was doing 20 pushups in the morning and 20 in the evening for the year of 2020. Figured that I would give this a shot as well just to see what gains or other benefits that I can get from it. Will post about it sometime in the future. Day 21 - January 25 Finally have reached the end of the fast. What's next you ask? Well some habits I will try to keep in place. Others I will slowly reintroduce, but do my best to maintain what I have accomplished during the fast.","title":"21 Days of Prayer and Fasting"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020-01-04-21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting/#21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting","text":"","title":"21 Days of Prayer and Fasting"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020-01-04-21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting/#background","text":"Each year, the church that I attend does a fast and prayer at the beginning of the year.

Yes, there is the scripture in Habakkuk about writing the vision and making it plan. I also think that journaling allows us to clear our heads from the things that we want to remember, but do not necessarily need to always keep readily on our minds. In other words, it allows you to \"clean out the attic\". I listened to a podcast one time, at the speaker was mentioning that we perceive the brain as more of a hard drive (i.e. permenant storage), when in actuality it is more like RAM (temporary storage). If you do not clean up the RAM periodically, then you will run into problems. On Linux systems, if you fill up the temporary storage, the OS might crash.","title":"Journal Daily"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020-01-04-21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting/#two-day-rule-for-exercising","text":"Matt D'Avella posted a video about what he refers to as the Two Day Rule. What is the Two Day Rule? In short, the rule is that you do not go more than two days between doing a workout. I have done this in the past, outside of a fasting period, and do agree that it does motivate you to be in better shape and allows you to have days off if your schedule does not allow workout time. For my implementation of the Two Day Rule, does not mean always working out. Sometimes I will substitute a true workout with a 30 minute walk, or a hike, or some other sort of physical activity.","title":"Two Day Rule for Exercising"},{"location":"lifestyle/2020-01-04-21-days-of-prayer-and-fasting/#water-tea-or-natural-juices","text":"As I have gotten older, I rarely drink sodas.

Went to Chipotle for lunch and an Indian restaurant for dinner. I only had water and tea to drink today. I spent the morning of today serving at church, so had to get up slightly earlier than normal. However, I was able to take a nap after the church services. I interacted with others about this and my previous post regarding my word of the year . It was very enlightening to hear about others' doing the same thing as myself, but for their personal benefit and mental health. I did not get around to exercising. Definitely is a must for tomorrow though. I did refrain from Facebook. I made a post yesterday on IG and Twitter, so I responded to messages and comments regarding those. I did find myself mindlessly scrolling, which I am trying to get out of the habit of.

I took that time to write in the journal and to do some reflecting, and map out some goals for the year. I prefer to set goals instead of make resolutions. While the two terms are similar in context, their definitions are different. My understanding after hearing and seeing people fail with keeping their resolutions, is that their resolutions should be broken down into smaller steps (i.e. goals). I have goals that I set last year that have not been accomplished. Those goals carried over into the new year in addition to the new ones that I have set for this year. I have found recipes in one of the crock pot cookbooks that I have. I have already had to modify them as they call for meat.

However we are not to focus on the past, but instead use the past as a lesson for what to and not to do in the future. One of the examples given was that if you are standing and facing forward, that you are not aware of what is going on behind you. The scripture that supports this, was Joshua 1:1-6. I have also been watching some videos on how to be better web developer. These videos talk about pricing your services, to building your portfolio, to developing a system that works for you.

During this time, I have managed to go outside during the daytime, weather permitting, and capture some sunlight. Being in the house all day quarantining yourself because of doctor's orders is no fun, but it is a necessary precaution. Not sure who found out that sunlight helps elevate your mood, but I do have to agree. I would say that it was like boost of energy. Not quite like the boost that Popeye gets after eating a can of Spinach, but more like never riding a bike before and once you get on the bike realizing the purpose of the training wheels. I have been told many of times how my post about squirrels taught me about women and food is insanely funny. I did not realize that it would catch on in the way that it did, but I am glad that I can share my story with others and they get something out of it.

This trip is the second time that I have done the zip line at this location. Mega Zip Line Make Your Reservation I was able to make my reservation via the Red Mountain Park website. It was easy and straightforward. Just have to pick one of the time slots that is available on the day that you choose, pay your money, and sign the waiver. At the time of this writing, the cost to do the zip line is $29 (USD) per person, not including credit card processing fees. There are some physical and age requirements that you have to meet in order to be able to do the zip line. Be sure that you read about those before making your reservation. Day of the Hike In order to get to the zip line adventure, you have to hike in from the parking lot, to the main office (which is a metal shipping container), to a secondary check-in point (which is another shipping container), and then to the Kaul Tower. I estimate that the total walk time was about 15-20 minutes. Once at the tower, you will be given a full body harness and helmet to wear. Climb the Tower To get to the zip line platform, you have to climb the tower from the inside. The tower is approximately 80 feet high. it has a very tight winding combination of steps and ladders. The steps are very steep and the ladders have nets that will catch you if you fall. The ladders resemble wood pallets. Prepare for Launch Once at the top, you'll have to wait until you are called up to the platform. Only two riders are allowed on the platform at a time as it is a small space. You will be connected zip line cable and given instructions on how to get off the platform. For me, the instructions given, varied from my actual experience. I am 6 feet tall. Before you launch, you are advised to squat down into your harness and make your way to the edge of the platform. If you are shorter, the harness will start pulling on you in the squatting position and the weight of your body will be on the zip line cable. Because I am taller, the harness did not start pulling on me until I went off of the platform. That being said, the initial second or two after coming off of the platform, felt like a free fall jump. Scary! Zip Away Next comes the fun part. Zip lining for 1000 feet. The wind will definitely get in your face. I did this during the winter season, so there were not mosquitoes out and about. However, in the summer months, you will want to consider wearing sunglasses as the last thing that you want to happen is a bug slamming into your eye at 30 miles per hour. As you get closer to the end of the zip-line, you will pass the dismount platform and gravity will slow you down and send you back towards the dismount platform. You will zip forward again to the dismount platform where the staff will help you get off the line and back onto the ground. Again I Say! Again! If you choose, you can go a second time. The second time, they will let you go backwards on the zip line if you choose. The first time, they do not let you go backwards as they want to adapt to the experience of zip-lining. I chose to go backwards the second time. There is definitely a difference going backwards as you cannot see what is coming up, but you do see the tower that you launch from fade off in the distance. Hiking Trails There are approximately 15 miles of hiking trails in the park. Some of the trails have overview or lookout points were you can get a greater view of the park and of the city of Birmingham. A lot of people had their dogs walking with them on the trails. There were also bike riders present. If you do choose to ride a bike at the park, be sure to ride a mountain bike and not a road bike as none of the trails are paved. The more popular trails do have a gravel surface, but the other trails are only dirt. There are trail maps at various locations in the park. The trails are marked with 4x4 inch markers mounted to the trees next to the trail. Each trail has a number and a color scheme so that you know what trail that you are on. When you come to some of the trail intersections, there is a trail marker, similar to the old concrete street signs, that denote which trail continues in which direction. These markers are noted as being done by a local Boy Scout troop in 2016. Old Iron Mines This park is situated in Southwest Birmingham. Back in the late 1800 and early 1900s, iron ore was dug out from the mountain and used to make steel. As you may know, during the Industrial Age, Birmingham, Alabama was known as the \"Pittsburgh of the South\" as it was producing comparable amounts of steel and iron as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Those mines are now abandoned and sealed, but are still in place. As part of this adventure to the park, I took a hike over to the Ishkooda #14 Mine. As you may can tell from the above and below picture, there are some rocks and dirt that has a pink-ish color to it. That coloring is the iron ore mixed in with the dirt. There was not much to see at this particular mine, but you could see a little bit into the mine via the Manway whole as it was not tightly sealed. Conclusion Overall I had a good experience and would go back to the park again, to hike on some of the other trails and to do some of the other adventures that they have available. If you are interested in visiting the Red Mountain Park, you can check out their website . I did not receive any sponsorship or compensation for this post.

The first phase of this project, which was to render videos from a queue of Kdenlive archive files. I have videos on my YouTube channel that discuss some of the aspects of the code. You can view the source code for this project on GitHub at https://github.com/almostengr/kdenlivetoyoutube . Raspberry Pi Traffic Light Control (2018) The purpose of this project is to educate children about the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields. Through the use of low cost devices and effective teaching, by grouping these subjects together, children are able to associate what they are learning with interactions with everyday items. For example, most children are aware of the purpose of a traffic light, but most are not aware of a traffic lights' internal workings. This project is designed to educate children by explaining the workings of the \"black box\" of a traffic light. This project targets the \"T, E, and M\" of \"STEM\" by using electronic circuits for controlling the lights, software for controlling the electronic circuits, and mathematical calculations for making timing decisions. Code for this project is downloadable from our GitHub page at https://github.com/almostengr/raspitraffic-stem . Home Automation with Home Assistant (2017) Home automation is one of the latest trends in technology. Using Home Assistant, I have been able to automate several repetitive tasks within my home. I will continue to add more automations and share those with the community. The configuration for my Home Assistant instance is available at https://github.com/almostengr/ha-config . FarmOS NWS (2017) The purpose of this project is to allow FarmOS to use data from the National Weather Service to allow it to make better decisions as well as to log data from a trusted weather source. Using data from the National Weather Service reduces the cost to get a FarmOS installation going as temperature, rain, humidity and other sensors do not have to be purchased. Furthermore, it reduces the maintenance costs by reducing the amount of infrastructure required to maintain the farm or garden.
