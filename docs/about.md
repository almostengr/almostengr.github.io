## Why A Blog?

Kenny started passively blogging in 2011 after watching
<a href="https://thealmostengineer.com/blog/2010.07.22-every-developer-needs-a-blog"
target="_blank">a presentation</a> by
Scott Hanselman that stated every software developer should
have a blog. Eventually that blogging habit faded.

Fast forward to 2018, Kenny attended a gardening workshop that mentioned that every
[gardener should have a journal](/gardening/2019/02/23/every-gardener-needs-a-journal).

As a IT professional, a blog allows you to save code snippets and copy and
paste them in your future projects. In
addition, it assists other developers with their coding projects, as it may be exactly
what they are looking for.

As a gardener, a blog allows you to track trends and historical information about what you have
done in your garden in previous seasons and years.

## Gardening

Gardening started as a hobby for Kenny. After a couple of seasons of success and
being able to literately taste the fruits of his labor, Kenny decided to
expand his green thumb skill set.

Information about the garden is based on conditions of USDA growing Zone 8a, located
in the southeastern United States. That being said, the recommendations and suggestions
that are made on this blog are for this growing zone and are not guaranteed to work in
other growing zones.
