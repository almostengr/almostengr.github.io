## Background

This convention was held virtually this year do to the coronavirus. The convention took place from August 19-23, 2020.
Givne that the convention was hosted online, there were some opportunities to network with others, but
not as many that you would normally have at an in-person convention.

I have decided to publish my notes online so that I have them for future reference and for others
to see what types of workshops were held.

be the foundational question that you ask yourself when posting content

* have to be focused and drivie and deliver; who can take the project and complete it with the obstacles
that may come up
* sometimes you have to take the opportunities that are presented instead of waiting on the opportunities
that are given to you
* Gain understanding about why someone has refused to do an assignment. Sometimes it is not insubordination,
but from a feeling of being overworked
* Reality is that sometimes you are the only person of color that may be there.
* The biggest difference can be whether you have opportunities. Not so much about the company being a
big supporter of diversity.
* Identify people that you want to be in their position and what they have done or are doing to get or
stay in that position. YOu can have them as a mentor or sponsor.
* You have to be able to reach out. Step outside your comfort zone.
* you don't need to be an experienced professional to be a change agent. You just need to be able to
come up with new ideas and to improve existing workflows
* dont necessarily need to leave if there are not many Blacks at the top of the organization. Representation
does matter as if we do not see those that look like us in the positions in where we want to go, we are
less inclined to stay with that organization or employer
* if you are in a position to make diversity happen, then do it. As mentioned, one of the panelists mentioned
that he prioritizing recommending Black people for opportunities and positions based off the skills
that he knows about that person
* in regards to COVID, it is important that employers are able to support their employees and have
some flexibility given the circumstances.
* because of social injustice, there are more discussions being held regarding the diversity of talent
within the organization and how to make the companies at hirind diverse talent and improve the business
at the same time
