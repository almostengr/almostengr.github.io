## Background

These are notes that I took from attended the NSBE 46th National Convention. This convention
was held virtually this year do to the coronavirus.

### What shapes your brand

* everyone and everything
* be consistent
* be genuine
* follow examples

### Crafting your personal brand

* 3 word to describe yourself
* 3 words family and friends
* 3 words peers/professors

* my words: smart, learner, skilled

#### are they consistent?

Looking for themes, similarities. Are there room to improve?

#### do they reflect your "natural self"?

* how much energy does it take to show up a certain way?

* think about the words that you want to keep. look at the various layers of your brand

### best personal brands

* show yourself in the best way possible
* what do you want to be known for?
* be your own CEO and control your image and assessing yourself
* find what makes you unique, project that to your audience and be confident with it

* if you have to fake it, sometimes that indicates that you may be in the wrong environment

### social media question

* social media and your brand: be confident in your brand; can you marry the two in a certain way
that attract audiences from both aspects
* would your boss or parent, be ok with what you are posting? Is it part of your brand? This should
be the foundational question that you ask yourself when posting content
is there a theme that can tie the things you represent together? is your social media for a specific
aspect or for multiple aspects
* find a common foundation in what you do if you have two professional brands that do not
necessarily mix

### Closing comments

* know yourself
* be consistent
* know that silence is not an option

## Leveling the Playing Field: The Art of Negotiation - 2020.08.20

* majority of people would be willing to discuss their salary with someone of their own race
* with higher starting salary, you will be paid more over 30 years compared to those that did not negotiate
* women will not negotiate as often as men will
* Black men have a tendency to make less than their white men counterparts
* women own about 40% of the businesses in US, but own get about 2.5 percent of the top jobs

### your next level life

* use your superpowers in your elevator speech
* you can accelerate your career when you are uncomfortable. expand your horizons = growth
* bring your true self to work. being authentic will make people question who you really are
* have different levels of friends when building your network

### questions

* talk about what you can offer, this can help with opportunities that you can take in the future;
allows for career advancement
* see how marketable that you are; see what you're worth at a different company
* sometimes, you can negotiate other things, like time off or location or remote work; sometimes
you need to have the conversations with your manager about your situation

### Build your negotiation skills

* have to practice it
* you don't get what you don't ask for
* work should not be different when it comes to negotiation

### Execute: The Meeting

* set the tone; friendly conversation; do not take it personally; do not overshare, try to stick to
your point and value statement

* how I measure success?  Getting more jobs and being contacted for doing what I do best.

* Strength Finders - book recommendation

### what's your intro? - exercise 

* what's your story? IT professional that has a tendency to build things that are both
technical and non-technical skillsets.
* do others see what you see? me doing those things. Some say that I make it look easy, but 
some of it comes naturally. I'm able to explain things so that people in different fields can understand.
* what is your brand? how do you get people to remember who you are? 

* do not be bashful about the things that we think that are important 

### who knew? 

* do you have a mentor? 
* do you have a sponsor? 
* what value they offer? 

* sponsor is one that will defend you and speak on your behalf when you are not there; helps you
get to the next level

### exercise 

* who are your mentors? none
* who are your sponsors? none
* are they aware (recognize) of your strengths? brand?

younger than yourself.

### Final thoughts

with your goals; know who you are and what you are trying to achieve
