## Background

These are notes that I took from attended the NSBE 46th National Convention. This convention
was held virtually this year do to the coronavirus.

## Personal Branding (Workshop)

### What shapes your brand

* everyone and everything
* be consistent
* be genuine
* follow examples

## Craafting your personal brand

* 3 word to describe yourself
* 3 words family and friends
* 3 words peers/professors

* my words: smart, learner, skilled

#### are they consistent?

Looking for themes, similarities. Are there room to improve?

#### do they reflect your "natural self"?

* how much energy does it take to hsow up a certain way?

* think about the words that you want to keep. look at the various layers of your brand

### best personal brands

* show yourself in the best way possible
* what do you want to be known for?
* be your own CEO and control your image and assessing yourself
* find what makes you unique, project that to your audience and be confident with it

* if you have to fake it, sometimes that indicates that you may be in the wrong environment

### social media question

* social media and your brand: be confident in your brand; can you marry the two in a certain way 
that attract audiences from both aspects 
* would your boss or parent, be ok with what you are posting? Is it part of your brand? This should 
be the foundational question that you ask yourself when posting content 
is there a theme that can tie the things you represent together? is your social media for a specific 
aspect or for mutliple aspects
* find a common foundation in what you do if you have two professional brands that do not 
necessarily mix

### Closing comments

* know yourself 
* be consitent 
* know that silence is not an option
