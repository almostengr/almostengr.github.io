## Background

These are notes that I took from attended the NSBE 46th National Convention. This convention
was held virtually this year do to the coronavirus.

## Personal Branding (Workshop) - 2020.08.20

### What shapes your brand

* everyone and everything
* be consistent
* be genuine
* follow examples

### Crafting your personal brand

* 3 word to describe yourself
* 3 words family and friends
* 3 words peers/professors

* my words: smart, learner, skilled

#### are they consistent?

Looking for themes, similarities. Are there room to improve?

#### do they reflect your "natural self"?

* how much energy does it take to hsow up a certain way?

* think about the words that you want to keep. look at the various layers of your brand

### best personal brands

* show yourself in the best way possible
* what do you want to be known for?
* be your own CEO and control your image and assessing yourself
* find what makes you unique, project that to your audience and be confident with it

* if you have to fake it, sometimes that indicates that you may be in the wrong environment

### social media question

* social media and your brand: be confident in your brand; can you marry the two in a certain way
that attract audiences from both aspects
* would your boss or parent, be ok with what you are posting? Is it part of your brand? This should
be the foundational question that you ask yourself when posting content
is there a theme that can tie the things you represent together? is your social media for a specific
aspect or for mutliple aspects
* find a common foundation in what you do if you have two professional brands that do not
necessarily mix

### Closing comments

* know yourself
* be consitent
* know that silence is not an option

## Leveling the Playing Field: The Art of Negotiation - 2020.08.20

* majority of people would be willing to discuss their salary with someone of their own race
* with higher starting salary, you will be paid more over 30 years compared to those that did not negotiate
* women will not negotiate as often as men will
* Black men have a tendency to make less than their white men counterparts
* women own about 40% of the businesses in US, but own get about 2.5 percent of the top jobs

### your next level life

* use your superpowers in your elevator speech
* you can accelerate your career whe nyou are uncomfortable. expand your horizons = growth
* bring your true self to work. being authentic will make people question who you really are
* have different levels of friends when building your network

### questions

* talk about what you can offer, this can help with opportunities that you can take in the future;
allows for career advancement
* see how marketable that you are; see what you're worth at a different company
* sometimes, you can negotiate other things, like time off or location or remote work; sometimes
you need to have the conversations with your manager about your situation

### Build your negotiation skills

* have to pratice it
* you don't get what you don't ask for
* work should not be different when it comes to negotiation
* [https://roberthalf.com/salary-guide](https://roberthalf.com/salary-guide) and [https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose](https://www.payscale.com/my/survey/choose) have salary information

### Prepare, Prepare, Prepare!

* know what you can and cannot negotiate
* if you get more, then you should bring more to the table
* create a plan
* create a mission statement - what is it that you want?
* create a value statement - have a running list of accomplishments as you progress in your career
* what are you willing to give up if your first ask (salary, vacation) is not available to negotiated
* role pay before you have to negotiate

### Excute: The Meeting

* set up the conversation, mention in the meeting invite what teh purpose of the meeting is 
* set the tone; friendly converstation; dont take it personally; dont overshare, try to stick to 
your point and value statement
* "go to the balcony"... otherwords, look at it from outside the box; there's a different view from the stage vs the audience

## interative process 

* continuously work on this sill over time
