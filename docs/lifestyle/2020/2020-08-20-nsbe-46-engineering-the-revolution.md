## Background

This convention was held virtually this year do to the coronavirus. The convention took place from August 19-23, 2020.
Givne that the convention was hosted online, there were some opportunities to network with others, but
not as many that you would normally have at an in-person convention.

I have decided to publish my notes online so that I have them for future reference and for others
to see what types of workshops were held.

that attract audiences from both aspects

be the foundational question that you ask yourself when posting content

necessarily mix

but from a feeling of being overworked
