These are notes that I took from attended the NSBE 46th National Convention. This convention 
was held virtually this year do to the coronavirus.

## Personal Branding (Workshop)

### What shapes your brand

* everyone and everything
* be consistent
* be genuine
* follow examples

## Craafting your personal brand

* 3 word to describe yourself 
* 3 words family and friends 
* 3 words peers/professors

* my words: smart, learner, skilled

#### are they consistent? 

Looking for themes, similarities. Are there room to improve?

#### do they reflect your "natural self"? 

* how much energy does it take to hsow up a certain way?
